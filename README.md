# Cataclysm-Bright Nights - Space Freezer Mod

## What does the 'Space Freezer Mod' actually DO?

Not much actually, it adds the following
- 'Space Freezer' item
- 'Large Space Freezer' item
- 'Space Freezer' furniture
- 'Large Space Freezer' furniture
- Options to the construction menu to build the space freezers as furniture powered by the grid.

That's Basically all this mod does. Adds two items and two grid-powered pieces of furniture that look just like the space heaters already in the game.

# Okay. BUT WHY?!

BECAUSE I WANTED MY WALK-IN FREEZERS OKAY!! IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR!?
